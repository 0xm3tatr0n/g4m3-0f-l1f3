## Color scheme ideas

number of pallettes (>4) selected based on type of `times`. 

within given pallette, provide pos/neg range colors which will be selected based on number of births/deaths. 

fork: use rainbow with same ranges for births/deaths but different bases (leaner scope).

example pallette

`````solidity

string[] example = ["births0", "births1", "births2", "base", "deaths0", "deaths1", "deaths2"];


`````
